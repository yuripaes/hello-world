# hello-world
This is the new repository from a new cycle.

This is the promise that I will learn how to effectively program this time. I am 34 years old now, and I have been playing with technology since my 15's.

Update 2023
Only this year I took it really serious. Machine Learning & Data Engineering made me feel like when I was first playing with technology. I am 37 years now with the same curiosity I have had my entire life.
